== Authentication Flow

=== Traditional Registration/Login

1. User registers with username, email, password via `/register`
2. Server validates input, hashes password with bcrypt
3. User record created in PostgreSQL database
4. JWT access token (1 hour) and refresh token (7 days) returned
5. Refresh token stored in database for session management

=== GitLab OAuth Flow

1. Frontend requests OAuth URL from `/gitlab/login`
2. User redirects to GitLab IMN authorization server
3. GitLab redirects back to `/callback` with authorization code
4. Server exchanges code for GitLab access token
5. Server fetches user info from GitLab API
6. User created or updated in local database
7. JWT tokens issued and returned to client
